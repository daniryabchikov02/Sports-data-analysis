# Sports-data-analysis
This project is designed to analyze football data, process relevant statistics, and provide predictions for upcoming matches. 

Features

Automated Data Fetching: Use of football API to fetch live and historical data for fixtures, team statistics, player stats, and betting odds.

Data Pipelines: Organized pipelines to fetch, process, and format data being generated by API integration files

Optimized Output: Reduced output size for efficient use with the ChatGPT API.

Modular Design: Each component is modular and reusable, making the platform easy to maintain and extend.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8+

An API key from a football data provider (API-FOOTBALL)

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/daniryabchikov02/Sports-data-analysis

Install the required Python packages

Set up the API key in a config.py file:

API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_api_key

Configure any other necessary settings in the config.py file.

How It Works

Data Retrieval:

The main.py script fetches data using fetcher files located in the api_files/ directory.

Data is fetched for the next two weeks of fixtures, and statistics are collected for the teams involved.

Data Processing:

The pipelines process raw API data into structured formats.

Match and team statistics are calculated and prepared for analysis.

Data Formatting:

Formatters optimize the output for ChatGPT API.

Prediction and Output:

The script generates predictions and insights based on the processed data, which can then be fed into the ChatGPT API for analysis.

Usage

Run the main.py script:
